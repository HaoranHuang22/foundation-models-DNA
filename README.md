# Deep learning based model for regulatory epigenome
I am doing my master thesis about learning DNA sequence activity like accessibility. There's a lot of research out there on this topic. Inspired by a great collection of research papers at inspired by [papers-for-molecular-design-using-DL](https://github.com/AspirinCode/papers-for-molecular-design-using-DL/blob/main/README.md?plain=1), I decided to create my own collection. My aim is to understand these papers better and share what I learn, hope this can accelerate more research come.
